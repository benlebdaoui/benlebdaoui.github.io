Hi, my name is Benjamin Lebdaoui. I am a mathematics major and soccer player at the University of Montevallo. I am a first-generation, Moroccan-American with a newfound passion for mathematics. I was previously set on becoming an engineer, which led me to get my AA in engineering and two internships in the field. I started out in Montevallo's math program with the intention of transferring after a year to get my engineering degree. However, a major knee injury that put my soccer career on hold and some guidance from a couple fantastic professors led me to discover my desire to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics.

I have interests in both pure and applied mathematics. I think there is beauty in both the abstractness of topology as well as using PDE's to model fluid dynamics. When I'm not listening to podcasts of mathematicians and physicists or practicing my Python skills on Leetcode, I still dedicate a lot of time towards soccer. This is not only with my team commitments, but also countless hours of rehab and extra workouts for my knee injury so I can get back to the sport I love.
