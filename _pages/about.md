Hi, I'm Ben and I am a soccer player and math major at the University of Montevallo.

I am a first-gen student and my primary focus entering college was strictly soccer. However, two knee surgeries and two redshirt years later, I've developed a strong passion for mathematics.

After graduating, I plan on pursuing a PhD in mathematics, and I am very interested in control theory, game theory, and data science.

In my free time I love watching soccer, playing poker, and reading. I also try to practice programming through projects relating to soccer.
