Hi, my name is Benjamin Lebdaoui. I am a mathematics major and soccer player at the University of Montevallo. I am a Moroccan-American first-generation college student with a passion for mathematics. I was previously set on becoming an engineer, which led me to get my AA in engineering and two internships in the field. I started out in Montevallo's math program with the intention of transferring after a year to get my engineering degree. However, a major knee injury that put my soccer career on hold and some guidance from a couple fantastic professors led me to discover my desire to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics.

I have interests in both pure and applied mathematics. I think there is beauty in both the abstractness of topology as well as using PDE's to model fluid dynamics. When I'm not listening to podcasts of mathematicians and physicists or practicing my Python skills on Leetcode, I still dedicate a lot of time towards soccer. This is not only with my team commitments, but also countless hours of rehab and extra workouts for my knee injury so I can get back to the sport I love. 

I hold two jobs on campus, one as an office admin assistant, and one as a peer tutor. My role as a tutor has not only been beneficial for me in reviewing lots of introductory calculus, physics, and chemistry skills, but it has only shown me that I really do enjoy teaching. This, combined with my desire to spend the rest of my life learning has made me certain that one day I would love to become a professor. I want to help other first-gen students navigate the murky waters that academia seems to be for those without proper guidance, like myself in my first couple years of undergrad.
