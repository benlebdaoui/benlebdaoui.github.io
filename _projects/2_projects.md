Machine Learning is one of my research interests for graduate school, so I have been taking steps to learn about it on my own. I'm utilizing AI to guide me through my studies and assist me when necessary. My long term goal is to create a program that can analyze a clip from a soccer match and calculate the xG for a shot on target. This will give me lots of experience using Pandas, Scikit-Learn, matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook. I'd love to be able to leave the program with Montevallo Men's Soccer as a tool to use for film analysis.


Dec 16, 2024: I started by going through this Mahcine Learning Introduction on LeetCode: [Intro to ML](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/machine-learning-101/)  

Dec 22, 2024: I am now through this TensorFlow tutorial, reading through the entire Beginner section along with all the hyperlinks along the way to learn the basics and vocabulary: [TensorFlow ML for Beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner)  

Jan 2, 2025: I made my first basic ML model using the Keras API by following the tutorial on TensorFlow (note this is not original): [Download ML Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benlebdaoui/benlebdaoui.github.io/main/assests/pdf/tensorflow_practice01.pdf)
