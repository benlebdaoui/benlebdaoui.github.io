Machine Learning is one of my research interests for graduate school, so I have been taking steps to learn about it on my own. I'm utilizing AI to guide me through my studies and assist me when necessary. My long term goal is to create a program that can analyze a clip from a soccer match and calculate the xG for a shot on target. This will give me lots of experience using Pandas, Scikit-Learn, matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook. I'd love to be able to leave the program with Montevallo Men's Soccer as a tool to use for film analysis.


I started by going through this Intro to ML on LeetCode: (https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/machine-learning-101/)
