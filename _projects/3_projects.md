Feb 4, 2025: I am creating a simple ML model to predict results of premier league matches. I am using a dataset from Kaggle that consists of all the necessary information from the 2023/24 Premier League season. I'll start with a simple classification model that will predict win/loss/draw. If it works, I will try to sophisticate it to give a scoreline and incorporate data from many years.
