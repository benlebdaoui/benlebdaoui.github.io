Feb 4, 2025: I am creating a simple ML model to predict results of premier league matches. I am using a dataset from Kaggle that consists of all the necessary information from the 2023/24 Premier League season. I'll start with a simple classification model that will predict win/loss/draw. If it works, I will try to sophisticate it to give a scoreline and incorporate data from many years.

Feb 9, 2025: I have finished cleaning and processing the data and creating the ML model. It works quite well, here is the code:

The only issue is that it requires someone to input lots of information manually for the model to work. I am going to create a database with all of the necessary information for each team, and then a user-friendly website, so that someone can simply select and a home and away team from a dropdown, and that will automatically input all necessary information to the function.
