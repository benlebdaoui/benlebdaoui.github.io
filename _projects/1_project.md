Here are some articles in Mathematics Modelling and Biology I am reading for background information:  
[BioMath](https://github.com/benlebdaoui/benlebdaoui.github.io/raw/assets/pdf/2018_BlackwoodChilds_LettersBioMath%20(2).pdf)  
[LaCrosse Virus Neuroinvasive Disease](https://github.com/benlebdaoui/benlebdaoui.github.io/raw/assets/pdf/Day%20et%20al.%202023%20-%20La%20Crosse%20virus%20neuroinvasive%20disease%20-%20the%20kids%20are%20not%20alright.pdf)

Research involves modelling the transmission of the mosquito-borne disease called the LaCrosse virus
I'll update this project more as I go along with the research in the spring semester
